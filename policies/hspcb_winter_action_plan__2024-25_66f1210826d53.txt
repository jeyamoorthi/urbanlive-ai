1. Executive Summary
Air pollution poses a significant challenge to public health and the environment in Haryana,
particularly during the winter months when climatic conditions exacerbate the problem. To
address this pressing issue, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has
developed a comprehensive Winter Action Plan aimed at mitigating air pollution through
targeted interventions across multiple sectors. The plan outlines a strategic approach to
reducing air pollution in Haryana, focusing on both immediate and long-term measures,
grounded in the state's commitment to improving air quality and enhancing the quality of life
for its residents.
Haryana is an agriculturally rich state with a rapidly growing industrial sector. However, the
state also faces significant environmental challenges, including high levels of particulate
matter (PM2.5 and PM10), especially during the winter season. The plan considers the state's
geographical and economic profile to develop targeted solutions that are both feasible and
impactful. Building on the existing regulatory framework, the plan aligns with national and
state-level environmental policies, incorporating guidelines from the Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) and leveraging state-specific regulations to ensure effective
implementation of air quality management strategies.
Haryana's Winter Action Plan integrates various state and national initiatives aimed at
curbing air pollution, including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), the FAME India
scheme, the Haryana Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy, and other relevant state-level
interventions. These programs provide a robust foundation for the plan's strategic objectives.
The plan details past achievements and outlines future interventions across key sectors such
as vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, construction activities, and crop residue
management, highlighting the successes and lessons learned from previous efforts and setting
clear targets for the upcoming winter season.
Recognizing the importance of a collaborative approach, the idea of stakeholder discussions
is to increase the participation from government agencies, private sector players, NGOs, and
community groups, ensuring that the plan is comprehensive and inclusive. A clear
implementation strategy is outlined, supported by robust governance mechanisms. This
includes the formation of a steering committee for regularly reviewing the progress, and
public feedback systems, all designed to ensure that the plan is executed effectively and
adapts to emerging challenges.

The plan also emphasises information, education, and communication (IEC) activities to raise
public awareness and encourage behavioural change, focusing on educating citizens about the
sources of air pollution, promoting eco-friendly practices, and involving the community in
pollution control efforts.
Citizens are equally responsible for contributing to lowering emissions in the state. Hence, a
few activities for citizens have been stated in the plan to involve the public in the broader
goal of improving air quality.
The Haryana Clean Air Programme for Sustainable Development (HCAPSD), in
collaboration with the World Bank, forms a critical component of the state's vision to curb air
pollution. This project aims to strengthen the state's capacity to manage air quality through
technical assistance, capacity building, and infrastructure development. The project is
currently undergoing approval by the Governing Committee and the State Cabinet members.
Concluding with a roadmap for future actions, the plan emphasises the need for sustained
efforts and continuous improvement. It calls for ongoing collaboration among stakeholders,
periodic reviews, and the integration of innovative solutions to ensure long-term air quality
improvement in Haryana. Through coordinated efforts and strategic interventions, Haryana is
committed to achieve cleaner air and a healthier environment for all its residents.

2. Introduction
Rising air pollution has become a major concern in the recent past, particularly in winter
months. The health impacts of air pollution are well captured. A 2019 study estimated the
exposure to high pollution levels has reduced the lifespan of Indians by 6-9 years and caused
premature deaths of 1.7 million Indians.1 Studies also show that air pollution poses a major
risk for people already affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, heart
disease, stroke and pneumonia. This is more so for the elderly and children. Therefore, air
pollution is as much a public health problem, as it is an environmental problem.
The list of the most polluted countries in the world, with India ranking 3rd globally in terms
of PM 2.5 emissions, according to standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO)2:

levels.3,4 Almost all sectors - be it education, health, industries, construction sites, or
transport, have been affected by these restrictions. In Delhi NCR area, the construction ban
created problems for the many daily wage labour employed in the sector.5 post-COVID,
disruptions in school learning caused by air pollution present a significant challenge,
particularly for students who rely solely on school, lack private tuition, and likely do not have
air purifiers at home. All air polluting industries needed to re-structure, and DG sets are also
being tightly regulated. In other words, no one is left unaffected.
This is also a culturally active time of the year, with many festivities as well as a largely
favourable weather for travel and leisure. Unfortunately, this coincidence further magnifies
the threat of air pollution during winters.
As a response to the emerging problem, the central government responded with establishing
the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), as a high-powered statutory
authority.6 The CAQM is India’s first experiment with a multi-sectoral air-shed level
regulatory body.
Now, with greater understanding, an airshed level approach is also beginning to take shape. It
is in the context of the very real consequences of air pollution, that the HSPCB present this
Winter Action Plan.
Existing source apportionment studies (TERI 2016, TERI 2018) for Delhi NCR region have
found the main contributing sectors to PM10 emissions to be transport, thermal power plants,
industries, burning of agro residue, burning of biomass and open waste burning. For PM2.5,
the main contributing sectors have been found to be construction dust and road dust.

Sector-wise contribution of PM2.5 in NCR in 2018

Based on the existing knowledge, Haryana has been taking several steps to prevent emissions
from major sources - like vehicles, industries, dust, biomass and agro-residue burning etc.
Deteriorating air quality in Delhi- NCR during the winter period triggers implementation of
the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). GRAP refers to a set of progressive restrictions,
which come into force, based on the 3-day air quality forecast.
In this context, Haryana’s Winter Action Plan 2024-25 aims to:
1) To the extent possible, reduce the possibility of GRAP being triggered, and
2) Reduce the number of days with ‘Poor’ or worse air quality.
The Winter Action Plan borrows from the success of the ongoing interventions and
introduces certain new measures to control emissions.

3. State Profile
3.1 Geographical and demographic landscape
Haryana is an Indian state, located in the north-western part of the country is ranked 21st in
terms of area, with less than 1.4% of India's land share. The state capital is Chandigarh,
which it shares with the neighbouring state of Punjab. Haryana has 6 administrative divisions,
22 districts, 71 sub-divisions, 93 revenue tehsils, 49 sub-tehsils, 140 blocks, 154 cities and
towns, 7,356 villages, and 6,225 villages panchayats.78

Haryana is located between 27°39' to 30°35' N latitude and between 74°28' and 77°36' E
longitude. 11Haryana is a landlocked state, bordered by Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to the
north, by Rajasthan to the west and south, while river Yamuna forms its eastern border with
Uttar Pradesh. Haryana surrounds the country's capital territory of Delhi on three sides (north,
west and south).
The average annual rainfall varies from about 200 mm to 1,400 mm and the average annual
temperature ranges between 1°C to 45°C.12

3.2 Presence in the Indo Gangetic Plain
Haryana is located in the Indo-Gangetic plain, a contiguous airshed home to more than 40%
of India’s population. This airshed is part of the airshed extending all the way from Pakistan
in the West to Bangladesh in the East.13
This means that all the pollution being measured within the state may not originate from
within state boundaries but may have reached there due to prevalent meteorological
conditions. As part of the World Bank study (2020), nearly 30% of Haryana’s PM levels are
from outside Haryana, while nearly 15% is from outside India (exclusive of the 30% outside
Haryana). 14

3.3 Presence in the National Capital Region
A large area of Haryana state is included in the economically important NCR of India for the
purposes of planning and development. 14 districts of Haryana are part of the NCR. This
makes the state’s air quality significantly dependent on the policies and directions of the
Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi and NCR, and their effective

3.4 Air Quality in Haryana (2021-2024)
While devising the winter action plan, it is important to understand the base level of pollution
and then set targets accordingly. As per the international best practices, such as the method
used by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), an annual average of the
previous three years is taken to define the base pollution level and, accordingly, targets for
pollution reductions are set to guide action and prepare action plans. Trend analysis helps to
understand the impact of action on long-term ambient concentration.
Air in urban areas has numerous pollutants (of these 12 are regulated under the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards [NAAQS]). However, in Haryana, over the past few years,
PM2.5 and PM10 have emerged as the major pollutants. The trend of these concentrations,
across the regions and years is shown in figure 1 and figure 2 below:

4. Regulatory framework
The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 empowers the central government to notify emission
norms for industries (such as cement, brick kilns, thermal power plants etc), and other
industrial processes or operations.15 These standards are monitored for compliance by the
Pollution Control Boards/Committees.
The Haryana State Pollution Control Board is strictly following the various emission
standards under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. In compliance with the Air
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, industrial emissions are regulated at the
establishment phase and operational phase through consent management, inspections and

monitoring mechanisms.16
The consent certificate is issued only if industrial establishments / processes fulfil general as
well as specific conditions (related to process, or technology, or inputs) to mitigate the impact
on the environment. In case where the consent certificate conditions and the directions issued
by the Board under the Act are violated, the Act empowers the Board to close defaulting units
and initiate criminal prosecution against them.

Section 3, Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981

18

Further, various NGT directions have empowered the Board to levy Environmental
Compensation (EC) from the defaulting units for the environmental damage caused.17
Vehicular emissions are monitored by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways at the
central level, and the Transport Department at the state level. Vehicles must comply with
these standards for plying on the roads. This compliance is checked by the Pollution Under
Check Centres, which issue Pollution Under Control Certificates to the vehicles.
The other sources of pollution including road dust, construction dust, agro-residue burning,
and open-waste burning, which are more fugitive in nature, are generally regulated by the
various directions from the CAQM. The CAQM is a unique body, in the sense that its
jurisdiction is beyond the UT of Delhi, including 14 of the neighbouring districts of Haryana,
and other districts from UP and Rajasthan.18 It is empowered with wide ranging powers to
take policy decisions on air quality related matters.
The CAQM has taken several policy decisions across various sectors of air pollution,
including industrial, vehicular, construction and agro residue burning. Further, the CAQM’s
Policy to curb pollution in the NCR Region (2022) provides guidance on the steps to be taken
to curb air pollution.19
In addition to existing laws, the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the National
Green Tribunal (NGT) are also part of the regulatory framework. The ban on plying of
overage vehicles was imposed by the NGT.

5. State and National level programmes for curbing air pollution
The central and state governments have implemented several programs to curb air pollution.
The important programmes are listed under:
5.1 National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)
The NCAP is a comprehensive strategy launched by the Government of India to tackle air
pollution across the country, with a specific focus on 131 non-attainment cities, including
those in Haryana. The programme sets a target to reduce particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)
by 40% by 2026,20 and it includes measures such as expanding the air quality monitoring
network, implementing city-specific action plans, and enhancing public awareness.
A total of ₹ 9,649.9 crore has been allocated to non-attainment cities of the country from
2019 to 2024.21

5.2 Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)
The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), launched on May 1, 2016, aims to provide
clean cooking fuel to rural and underprivileged households by offering free LPG connections
to women belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. By replacing traditional cooking
methods that rely on biomass and other polluting fuels, PMUY significantly reduces indoor
air pollution, which is a major health hazard in rural areas. As of August 2024, a total of
10,33,43,64923 beneficiaries have received connections in the whole of the country, and
Haryana has successfully provided over 11 lakh connections under the Pradhan Mantri

23

22

Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). Around 10 lakh households have availed themselves of at least one
refill, reflecting the widespread adoption and utilization of the scheme across the state.24

5.3 Faster Adoption of Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME)
The FAME India Scheme aims to reduce vehicular emissions by promoting the adoption of
electric and hybrid vehicles. Through financial incentives for consumers and manufacturers,
as well as the development of supporting infrastructure like charging stations, FAME
contributes to reducing air pollution by encouraging a shift from traditional fossil fuelpowered vehicles to cleaner, electric alternatives. This initiative is crucial for mitigating
vehicular pollution, particularly in urban areas, which is a significant concern for air quality
in Haryana.
The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) & Electric Vehicles in India (FAME
India) implemented by the Ministry of Heavy Industries, commenced on 1st April 2019 and
spans five years, with a total budgetary support of ₹ 10,000 crore. The primary focus is on the
electrification of public and shared transportation, offering purchase incentives for 7,090 ebuses, 5 lakh e-3 wheelers, 55,000 e-4 wheeler passenger cars, and 10 lakh e-2 wheelers.
Additionally, the scheme supports the creation of charging infrastructure. Under FAME India
Scheme, the Ministry of Heavy Industries sanctioned 3,397 electric vehicle charging stations
across 68 cities in 25 States/UTs and 1,576 charging stations across 9 expressways and 16
highways.25

5.4 Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission)
The Swachh Bharat Mission focuses on eliminating open defecation and improving solid waste
management across India. By promoting sanitation infrastructure and encouraging behavioural
change, this mission plays a crucial role in reducing environmental pollution, including air
pollution from the burning of waste. In Haryana, the Swachh Bharat Mission is integral to
creating cleaner urban and rural environments, thereby contributing to the state’s efforts to
manage and mitigate air pollution, particularly during the winter season when waste burning is
more prevalent.

5.5 PM e-Bus Seva
The PM e-Bus Sewa initiative is a national programme aimed at expanding and enhancing
electric bus services across India’s cities, including those in Haryana. This program is
designed to reduce urban air pollution by promoting the use of electric buses, which produce
zero tailpipe emissions. Under the initiative, financial support is provided to state
governments and urban local bodies to procure electric buses and develop the necessary
charging infrastructure. By integrating these eco-friendly buses into public transportation
systems, the PM E-Bus Sewa seeks to offer a sustainable alternative to conventional dieselpowered buses, thereby significantly cutting down on urban vehicular emissions and
improving overall air quality in Haryana's cities.
5.6 Haryana EV Policy, 2022
The Haryana Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy is a forward-looking initiative aimed at
accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in the state to combat air pollution and promote
sustainable transportation. The policy offers a range of incentives, including subsidies on
electric vehicle purchases, tax exemptions, and support for establishing EV charging
infrastructure. It also encourages the manufacturing of electric vehicles and components
within the state, positioning Haryana as a hub for EV development.
Haryana has supported the purchase of more than 1,200 EVs, by disbursing financial
incentives of more than Rs 34 crore till March 2024.

6. Sector-wise activities for emission control
6.1 Greening
As per the National Forest Policy, 1988, one-third of the total land area of the country should
be under forest or tree cover. As per the 2021 report of the Forest Survey of India, Haryana
has about 3.6% of its land area under forests.29
Further, as Haryana lies in the semi-arid region, the prevalence of loose soil dust is more.
Greening helps prevent erosion of topsoil from winds, especially in the summer season. This
dust can get deposited on other surfaces (like roads), making it vulnerable to re-suspension.
6.1.1 Ongoing actions
For 2023-24, the state of Haryana achieved 88% of its plantation target of 98 lakh plants and
shrubs. After a detailed identification exercise, nearly 76% of the identified hotspots have
already been corrected, and converted to green spots by the urban local bodies and other
agencies.30 The conversion of other identified hotspots is under progress.
Below are the details of the department-wise plantation targets and the corresponding
achievements in 2023-2431:

6.2 Road Dust

6.2.1 Ongoing actions
One of the major reasons for road dust is disintegrating road surfaces, which can lead to
potholes.

27

In this context, in 2024-25, the state will be focussing on:
1) Identifying major roads which need repair, by leveraging government resources, as
well as citizen-to-government communication. One of the resources for this is the
SAMEER App, developed by CPCB.32
2) Completing the repair of the identified stretches or patches, ahead of the winter
season.
3) Hiring of additional mechanised sweepers/sprinklers where required, and inter-agency
leasing of idle mechanised sweepers or sprinklers.
Dust Control Management Cells (DCMCs) are specialized units established by the
Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to manage and mitigate dust pollution in
various regions. In the context of the National Capital Region (NCR), where air quality issues
are particularly severe due to high levels of particulate matter (PM), DCMCs play a crucial
role.
Role of Dust Control Management Cells (DCMCs):
1. Monitoring and Assessment: DCMCs are responsible for monitoring dust emissions
from various sources such as construction sites, roads, and industrial areas. They
assess the effectiveness of dust control measures and identify areas requiring
improvement.
2. Implementation of Control Measures: DCMCs oversee the implementation of dust
control measures. This includes enforcing regulations, promoting best practices, and
ensuring compliance with guidelines designed to minimize dust emissions.
3. Coordination and Collaboration: They coordinate with various stakeholders,
including local authorities, construction companies, and industrial operators, to ensure
that dust control measures are effectively implemented. This includes facilitating
communication and collaboration between different entities involved in dust
management.

5. Reporting and Data Collection: DCMCs collect data on dust levels and the
effectiveness of control measures. They report this data to regulatory bodies and use it
to refine strategies and policies.
Dust Portal
The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has developed a Dust Portal for the remote
monitoring of dust pollution at Construction and Demolition (C&D) sites exceeding 500 square
meters within the National Capital Region (NCR) and under the jurisdiction of urban local
bodies.

These sites are mandated to install CCTV cameras, low-cost sensors, and submit a self-audit report
to facilitate effective remote monitoring. The self-audit report, which is assessed by the HSPCB
officers, requires sites to document their compliance with mandatory and recommended dust
mitigation practices. These practices include, but are not limited to, installing green screens around
the construction site, utilizing water sprinkling to suppress dust, and covering stored construction
materials.

29

Officers review the audit reports based on the attached photographs and videos, score the reports,
and either accept or reject them based on the site's adherence to the required dust control
measures.
6.2.2 Planned actions
Even though roads may be in good condition, dust from nearby sources often tends to get
deposited on the road. This dust is susceptible to re-suspension, mainly due to vehicular
movement. In this context, in 2024-25, the state will focus on:
1) Undertaking preventive maintenance of all sprinkling and sweeping machines, to
ensure they are in working condition.
2) Efficiently operating the existing sprinkling and sweeping machines, to minimise resuspension of road dust due to movement of vehicles.
3) Procuring new machines at the municipal authorities’ level, based on the gap to
achieve the 50% road sweeping / sprinkling target by 31-12-2023 (as per CAQM
Policy for NCR region, 2022).33
4) Ensuring that the road sweeping machines are effectively cleaning the road, through
surprise inspections and test runs.

6.4 Emissions from Diesel Generator Sets

6.4.1 Ongoing actions
Many commercial, industrial and residential establishments keep generator sets as a backup
source for electricity supply. While proving to be a critical backup source, diesel generator
(DG) sets are found to be the most polluting.
Throughout the year, in various review meetings, the power distribution companies of the
state have been directed to undertake all measures (such as upgrading power infrastructure) to
provide 24 X 7 uninterrupted supply of power.36,37 This would prevent the need to operate
generator sets in the first place. In the short term, in the context of generator sets, all
establishments must comply with the CAQM Direction No. 73.38 This direction mandates DG

Fire Incidents reported by HARSAC (2016-23)

The measures taken by the State Government to control paddy stubble burning include:
1) Providing an incentive @ Rs. 1000/- per acre for in-situ / ex-situ management of
paddy crop residue.
2) Providing an incentive @ Rs. 7000/- per acre for diversification of paddy area with
alternative crops under Mera Pani Meri Virasat Scheme.
3) Providing an incentive @ Rs. 4000/- per acre for adoption of direct sowing of rice.
4) The New and Renewable Energy Department already identified & formed a cluster of
villages, producing biomass in the vicinity of various industries in consultation with
the Agriculture & Farmer Welfare Department.
5) Red Zone Panchayat to receive Rs. 1,00,000/- for achieving Zero Burning.
6) Yellow zone Panchayat to receive Rs. 50,000/- for achieving Zero Burning.
7) Transportation charges of Bales @ 500/- per acre limited to max of Rs. 15,000/- to
Gaushalas.
8) Various IEC activities for farmer training through farmer vans, wall paintings etc.
Haryana is making substantial progress in managing paddy straw, a major contributor to air
pollution, particularly due to stubble burning. The state has initiated several large-scale
projects aimed at converting paddy straw into bio-energy, thereby mitigating environmental
impacts while also generating economic opportunities. One significant project is the
Compressed Biogas (CBG) Plant located in Jhajjar, which processes 20 Metric Tons per Day
(MTD) of paddy straw, consuming a total of 150 MTD. Another notable initiative is the 2G
Ethanol Plant in Panipat, with a capacity of 100 Kilo Litres per Day (KLPD) and using 52.5
MTD of paddy straw. Thermal power stations in Haryana are expected to utilize 2.75 Lakh
36

Metric Tons (LMT) of paddy straw annually in 2024-25. Additionally, biomass-based power
plants are actively contributing to paddy straw management. As of May 2024, there are six
operational plants with a combined capacity of 65.4 MW and an annual paddy straw
consumption of 4.9 LMT. Moreover, four more plants are in the pipeline, which will add a
total capacity of 31.8 MW.
In the realm of briquetting, Haryana is establishing 23 new plants, which together will have
an annual paddy straw consumption capacity of 2.30 LMT.
Bio- Energy Policy, 2018:
The Haryana Bio-Energy Policy, introduced on December 7, 2018, by the Haryana
Department of New and Renewable Energy (DNRE), is aimed at enhancing the utilization of
biomass resources to produce renewable energy. The primary goal of the policy is to reduce
reliance on fossil fuels and address environmental challenges by promoting the development
of bio-energy projects. This includes the establishment of biomass-based power plants,
biogas plants, and ethanol production facilities, which help in managing agricultural waste
more effectively and mitigating pollution from stubble burning.
The policy supports the advancement of technologies such as Compressed Biogas (CBG) and
2G ethanol production, encouraging research and development to improve efficiency and
lower costs. It provides financial incentives and subsidies to stimulate investment in bioenergy projects and the development of necessary infrastructure.
Regulation and standardization are central to the policy, with clear guidelines and standards
established for biomass energy production, including emissions norms and quality criteria for
biomass fuels. The policy also includes mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement to
ensure compliance and assess project performance.
Furthermore, the policy emphasizes integration with broader environmental and agricultural
policies, ensuring a cohesive approach to biomass resource management. Engaging with
stakeholders—such as farmers, industry players, and local communities—is crucial for
effective implementation. Overall, the Haryana Bio-Energy Policy aims to contribute to
sustainable energy production, improved waste management, and economic development.

37

6.5.2 Planned actions
For the 2024-25 season, the state has devised a comprehensive strategy to manage the paddy
straw and stubble generated. With an estimated 7,314,440 metric tons (MT) of straw to be
managed, the state will employ a combination of in-situ and ex-situ strategies, alongside
promoting its use as fodder. Specifically, around 2,462,882 MT of the straw will be utilised
as fodder, supporting the livestock sector. In-situ management practices, which involve the
incorporation of straw back into the soil, will handle approximately 3,141,892 MT, thereby
improving soil health and reducing the need for burning. The remaining 1,709,666 MT will
be managed through ex-situ methods, which include using straw for industrial applications
and energy production, ensuring that the stubble is effectively and sustainably managed
across the state.
1) An estimated quantity of 13.54 Lakh metric tons of paddy stubble is likely to be
consumed in the major industries.
2) Deploying more than 80,000 Crop Residue Machines to manage more than 14 lakh
hectares of paddy straw, with most of these machines going to small and marginal
farmers.
3) Department has taken initiative to target 5 Lakhs acre paddy area through Pusa Bio
Decomposer.
4) State government will provide Pusa bio decomposer kits to the farmers free of cost.
5) Increased use of IEC activities to make farmers aware about the existing schemes and
incentives to avoid stubble burning.
6) Identifying and leveraging champions from each village and block as change agents,
who have availed the benefits of the existing schemes.
7) Increasing the use of satellite-based monitoring from HARSAC to identify active fire
locations.
8) Deploying task forces at District, Block, and Panchayat level in advance of the
harvesting season, to create a ‘presence of the administration’ in hotspots, and
9) After exhausting the above measures, levying Environmental Compensation on the
defaulting farmers as per the following schedule:41

6.6.1 Ongoing actions
In 2022, the state notified two important policies - the Haryana Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy
and the Vehicle Scrapping Policy.42,43 As of August 2024, Haryana has more than 1,000,00
EVs. More than 70% of these EVs were registered after the notification of EV Policy. By
ensuring speedy implementation of a web portal, Haryana has already supported the purchase
of more than 1,200 EVs, by disbursing incentives of more than Rs 34 crore.44 Notably, the

demand for certain segments has already exceeded the 5-year limit. A proposal for increasing
this limit is under consideration of the state government.
EV registration trend in Haryana (2019-24)

*2024 is up to the month of August

For the Vehicle Scrapping Policy to be successful, the state needs two key enabling
infrastructures - Automated Testing Stations (ATS) and Registered Vehicle Scrapping
Facilities (RVSFs). The state government is in the process of establishing these ATS on PPP
mode. As of September 2023, Haryana has 5 RVSFs.
Once a vehicle is handed over to the RVSF, the earlier vehicle owner is given a Certificate of
Deposit (CoD). So far, 1,250 certificates of deposit (CoD) have been issued. When the same
person buys a new vehicle and submits this CoD at the time of vehicle registration, the person
shall receive a rebate on motor vehicle tax. The rebate shall be equal to lesser among 10% of
the motor vehicle tax, or 50% of the scrap value (mentioned in the CoD).
Further, all Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) in the NCR region are inspecting the
calibration of the equipment at Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) centres. Noncompliant PUCC centres have been challaned, or shut down, based on the degree of noncompliance.
Further, NCR districts in Haryana are implementing CAQM Direction No. 70.45 This
direction mandates the registration of only CNG/electric autos in NCR districts.

For the seamless and efficient traffic management and minimising traffic congestion in the
jurisdiction of the NCR, the State has constituted dedicated task forces with representatives of
the Departments concerned to continuously monitor and take corrective steps towards smooth
traffic management. An “Intelligent Traffic Management System” (ITMS) is operational in
the State.
The Haryana government has implemented a ban on older vehicles to address rising air
pollution levels in the state. Under this regulation, diesel vehicles that are 10 years or older
and petrol vehicles that are 15 years or older are prohibited from operating on the roads.

1) Spread awareness about the motor vehicle tax rebate available under the Haryana
Vehicle Scrapping Policy, to ensure that people get their end-of-life or close to endof-life vehicles scrapped.
2) Spread awareness about the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court & NGT orders
regarding ban on plying of end-of-life vehicles.
3) ICE activities to be undertaken for E-trucks and Tractors to increase their adoption in
the state.
4) Focus on the deregistration and scrapping of older vehicles, as well as those polluting
above permissible limits.
Further, efforts will be made to minimise traffic congestion in NCR areas. To achieve this,
the state will:
1) Encourage government and private offices to have staggered office timings, to
distribute the flow of traffic.
2) Review the working of traffic light systems, ahead of the winter season.
3) Ensure deployment of traffic police at points prone to congestion.
4) Deploy anti-smog guns on congestion points, especially at peak hours.
5) Low Emission Zones pilot implementation in hotspot cities i.e. Gurugram and
Faridabad.

6.7 Industrial Emissions
6.7.1 Ongoing actions
The HSPCB, through its Regional Offices, has held a series of sensitization and stock-taking

42

meetings, to make stakeholders aware of various CAQM directions. The state government
and concerned agencies are speeding up providing Piped Natural Gas connections, to allow
operation of generator sets on dual fuel mode.
Although, industries are an integral part of Haryana’s economy, they also contribute to air
pollution within the state. In compliance with the CAQM directions and CAQM Policy for
NCR region (2022), the state is taking the following measures to abate industrial emissions:
1) Clean fuel strategy: As of today, all industries in industrial clusters in NCR are
running on approved fuels. Most of such industries are operating on biomass fuels.
Further, in March 2023, the state government announced a scheme to provide
financial assistance of 30% of the total cost of conversion of boilers to run on
PNG/CNG, for MSMEs.47

2) Process upgradation: More than 99% of brick kilns in the state have shifted to zig-zag
technology. This has helped reduce the contribution of brick kilns to air pollution.
3) Emissions monitoring: The HSPCB monitors the emission stacks of all red category
industries using Online Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (OCEMS). In cases
of exceedance and delays, the industrial units are notified and asked to take corrective
action. As of now, 291 industries in Haryana have installed the Continuous
Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS). Additionally, The Haryana State Pollution
Control Board (HSPCB) has implemented a dedicated portal to monitor industry
compliance with the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS). This portal
plays a crucial role in tracking and ensuring that industries provide real-time
emissions data to the Pollution Control Board.
The portal is designed to facilitate continuous oversight of industrial emissions,
ensuring that industries adhere to the emission standards prescribed by the regulatory
authorities. By receiving real-time data, the PCB can promptly identify any deviations
from the standards and take necessary corrective actions to mitigate pollution.
4) Inspections and monitoring: The HSPCB has a roster of inspections for red, orange
and green categories of industries. Through these inspections, the HSPCB monitors
emissions from industrial units. Action is being taken on defaulting units as per
procedure prescribed under the law.
6.7.2 Planned actions
The HSPCB through its Regional Offices will intensify the inspections and monitoring of
industries. Further, the state government will increase its extension activities to ensure that
financial incentives for clean fuel transition are known and availed by MSMEs.

6.8 Biomass Burning
6.8.1 Ongoing actions
Household combustion emits more than half of all global black carbon emissions, a major
component of fine particulate matter.48 A significant section of the population of the state, are
dependent on cooking using: (i) easily available but polluting fuels (such as wood, animal
dung and crop waste and coal), or (ii) inefficient stoves. Both result in harmful household air
pollution.
The state government is implementing the PM Ujjwala Yojana, aiming to ensure access to
clean cooking fuel to all eligible households.

6.8.2 Planned actions
Apart from biomass burning for cooking, biomass burning for heating has also emerged as a
problem, especially for the poor and vulnerable. In peak winter, the poor and vulnerable
segments of society resort to burning of biomass, to keep themselves warm. In the winter
season, this too contributes to the high pollutant concentrations in the air. To prevent this
situation, the state will:
1) Ensure that all government shelters for the poor and vulnerable are well stocked with
warm clothes and heating coils.
2) Create awareness among civil society organisations to contribute clean, warm clothes
for the poorer segments in society.
Further, unauthorised burning of open waste will be monitored, and penalised by teams from
the urban local bodies.

Ahead of the festive season, the state will be implementing a total ban on manufacturing,
sale, and distribution of firecrackers.
6.9.2 Planned actions
By taking this decision in September (a month in advance of the ban), the state has
proactively tried to reduce the ‘sunk cost’ in the firecracker supply chain, thereby protecting
lives of its residents, and of those employed in the firecracker sector as well.
In 2024-25, inspection teams constituted under the Deputy Commissioners will shortly start
inspections, to check establishment of the firecracker supply chain. Further, wide publicity
will be given to the ban, to make the citizens aware.

6.10 Air Quality Monitoring

6.10.1 Ongoing actions
Air quality monitoring enables us to track changes in air quality over time, identify pollution
hotspots and exposure patterns, and inform action plans. HSPCB monitors criteria pollutants
regularly. Currently, there are 29 real-time monitoring stations and 39 manual monitoring
stations in Haryana.
Source apportionment and emission inventory studies (in combination) help us to understand
local sources of air pollution and their relative contributions. So far, source apportionment
studies for Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonipat, and Panipat are in progress. An interim report for
Faridabad (being done by TERI) found construction and road dust to be the major
contributors for high PM10 levels and Road Dust and Industries for PM2.5. The status of the
source apportionment studies in the state is captured below:

The HSPCB aims to undertake measures which, to the extent possible, prevent the AQI
forecast to breach the thresholds for Stage I of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). To
achieve this, the pollution sources in the state must be abated with greater intensity. This is
because in winter, due to temperature inversion, pollutants tend to remain suspended in the
atmosphere at lower heights.
To that extent, a series of review meetings at district headquarters, will be held under the
chairmanship of Chairperson, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) from October
to December, to review the enforcement of air pollution abatement actions across
departments in all the 14 NCR districts of Haryana. In each of these meetings, a total review
of the contributing sectors will be taken, which includes, construction and demolition
activities, road dust, vehicular emissions, and emissions from DG sets, etc.
The state will undertake comprehensive stakeholder consultations across various sectors to
ensure a holistic approach to address air pollution. These consultations will involve active
participation from both government agencies and private sector players, including industry
representatives, environmental NGOs, and community organisations. The goal is to gather
diverse perspectives, leverage sector-specific expertise, and foster collaborative solutions that
align with the state's environmental objectives. Through these discussions, the state aims to
create a unified and actionable plan that addresses the challenges faced by different sectors,
ensuring broad-based support and effective implementation of air pollution control measures.
Here are some key topics for stakeholder discussions that can be done as part of the Winter
Action Plan to curb air pollution:
7.1 Vehicular Emissions Control:
Discussion Points: Strengthening the Pollution Under Control (PUC) certification process,
promoting electric vehicles (EVs), improving public transportation, and refilling off the
potholes and implementing stricter emission norms for private and commercial vehicles.

49

7.2 Industrial Emission Standards:
Discussion Points: Enhancing emission control technologies, monitoring compliance with
existing standards, and incentivizing cleaner production methods,.
7.3 Construction and Demolition Waste Management:
Discussion Points: Implementing dust control measures at construction sites, promoting the
use of green building materials, enforcing regulations on waste disposal, and fostering
collaboration between government bodies and private construction firms.
7.4 Agricultural Practices and Crop Residue Management:
Discussion Points: Encouraging sustainable farming practices, promoting alternatives to
stubble burning, and facilitating access to eco-friendly agricultural technologies for farmers.
7.5 Urban Planning and Green Spaces:
Discussion Points: Integrating green infrastructure in urban planning, expanding urban green
cover, and involving private developers in creating and maintaining green spaces within
cities.
7.6 Public Awareness and Behaviour Change:
Discussion Points: Designing effective public awareness campaigns, promoting eco-friendly
behaviours, leveraging social media for outreach, and engaging community leaders in air
pollution prevention efforts.
7.7 Monitoring and Data Sharing:
Discussion Points: Enhancing air quality monitoring infrastructure, ensuring real-time data
sharing among stakeholders, developing a unified database for air quality data, and involving
tech companies in creating innovative monitoring solutions.

50

7.8 Regulatory Framework and Policy Implementation:
Discussion Points: Reviewing existing air pollution regulations, identifying gaps in
enforcement, exploring new policy initiatives, and discussing the role of private sector
compliance.
These topics provide a broad framework for stakeholder discussions, ensuring that all
relevant aspects of air pollution control are addressed through collaborative efforts.

8. Enabling Implementation
8.1 Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)
Currently, Delhi’s AQI is the reference point for implementation of GRAP. Acknowledging
the presence of Haryana in the same airshed as Delhi, this Winter Action Plan aims to
minimise Haryana’s contribution to air pollution. However, the transboundary nature of air
means that the state government must be prepared for effective implementation of GRAP. It
should be noted that many of the measures under GRAP are part of existing control measures
that are being taken. These include measures related to mitigation of dust and vehicular
emissions.
GRAP’s objective is to balance protection of public health and maintaining livelihoods. This
can only be achieved if GRAP restriction period is minimal but implemented effectively. To
ensure speedy and effective implementation of GRAP, the state government/HSPCB will:
1) Monitor the 3-day forecast of air quality from System of Air Quality and Weather
Forecasting and Research (SAFAR)49 daily.
2) Constitute district-level task forces with representation from all stakeholder
departments to review the actions corresponding to the GRAP stages.
3) Streamline reporting and monitoring of on-ground actions by departments.
4) Review the implementation of GRAP at regular intervals
8.2 Review and Monitoring Mechanism for the Winter Action Plan
To ensure the effective implementation and success of the Winter Action Plan, a robust
review and monitoring mechanism will be established. This mechanism will be structured
around continuous assessment, data-driven decision-making, and transparent reporting. The
following components will be integral to the process:
1. Formation of a Steering Committee:
A high-level steering committee will be constituted under the chairmanship of Member
Secretary, HSPCB and Senior Environmental Engineer (in charge of Air Cell) as convener,
comprising representatives from key government departments, experts from environmental
organisations, industry stakeholders, and academic institutions.

49

SAFAR is an air quality forecasting system, developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). Using existing air quality
data as well as meteorological information, SAFAR can provide air quality forecasts of 1-3 days for Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad.

52

The committee will oversee the overall implementation of the Winter Action Plan, provide
strategic guidance, and ensure inter-departmental coordination.
2. Regular Progress Reviews:
Quarterly review meetings will be conducted by the steering committee to assess the progress
of various initiatives outlined in the Winter Action Plan. These meetings will focus on
identifying bottlenecks, challenges and reviewing the performance of different sectors, and
making necessary adjustments to the plan.
3. Public Feedback and Engagement:
Mechanisms for public feedback will be established, including online portals and community
meetings. Citizen feedback on air quality and the effectiveness of local interventions will be
an important input for the review process.
This review and monitoring mechanism is designed to ensure that the Winter Action Plan is
implemented effectively, with continuous oversight and the flexibility to adapt to evolving
challenges.

53

9. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities
The government can implement various types of Information, Education, and Communication
(IEC) strategies to effectively raise awareness and drive behavioural change related to air
pollution.
Here are the few types of IEC initiatives:
9.1 Mass Media Campaigns:

to policy discussions and decision-making processes related to air quality
management.
b) Policy Briefs and Reports: Publishing policy documents, white papers, and research
reports that inform and guide stakeholders on air pollution control strategies.
9.7 Partnerships and Collaborations:
a) Public-Private Partnerships: Collaborating with businesses, NGOs, and other
organisations to jointly address air pollution, enabling us to achieve state's goals more
effectively and efficiently.

55

9.8 Incentive Programs:
a) Competitions and Rewards: Organizing contests, such as clean air challenges, and
providing rewards for communities, schools, or individuals who contribute
significantly to reducing air pollution.
b) Recognition Programs: Establishing awards and recognition for local governments,
organisations, and individuals who demonstrate exemplary efforts in air quality
improvement.
By employing a mix of these IEC strategies, the government can effectively reach different
segments of the population, educate them about air pollution, and inspire meaningful action
to improve air quality.
When it comes to air pollution, citizens are as much a part of the problem as they are of the
solution. Keeping in mind both the preventive aspects and the greater health risks associated
with pollution in winter, the state will launch a 360-degree IEC campaign. The campaign will
urge citizens to:
1) Avoid unnecessary use of vehicles and choose public transport wherever possible.
Scrap personal vehicles which are nearing end-of-life.
2) Use non-polluting modes of travel, including CNG/electric vehicles - whether public
or private.
3) Ensure good maintenance of personal vehicles, to minimise emissions.
4) Ensure regular updation of the PUC certificates of the existing private vehicles.
5) Avoid starting any new major construction/ demolition activity during the winter
months.
6) Undertake firecracker free festivities and use traditional non-polluting alternatives
(such as Diyas).
7) Avoid throwing garbage in unauthorised areas, to prevent chances of open waste
burning.
8) Provide electric heaters to security guards in residential societies and colonies, to help
them keep warm.
9) Report air pollution activities through SAMEER App.
10) Use indoor air purifiers, in case air quality deteriorates to poor in health facilities,
schools, public offices etc,
56

11) Undertake personal precautions (such as wearing masks etc) when air quality
deteriorates to poor, keeping in mind the existing medical condition of individuals.
12) Use of Public transportation and reduce the dependency on private vehicles in order to
reduce emissions and congestion.
13) Adoption of EVs in the state especially for promotion of E-trucks and E-Tractors.
14) Undertake stakeholder consultations, round tables and large conclaves to increase the
awareness of FAME and state EV incentives.

57

10. Actions for Citizens
To support our collective efforts in reducing pollution and maintaining a healthy
environment, we encourage all citizens to take the following detailed actions:
10.1 Avoid Open Burning
Open burning of leaves, crop residues, and other waste materials releases a significant
amount of pollutants into the air. This practice not only deteriorates air quality but also poses
health risks.

10.1.1 Planned Actions
•

Composting: Convert organic waste such as leaves and kitchen scraps into compost,
which can be used to enrich soil.

•

Waste Disposal: Use municipal waste collection services to dispose of non-organic
waste properly.

•

Each household shall segregate the solid waste in the form of organic waste, inorganic waste,
domestic hazardous waste in three different containers and the same may be delivered to the
authorized waste pickers having vehicles of three compartments. These waste pickers shall
do further activities as under:

1. The waste pickers shall transfer the different kind of waste in the GPS enabled
compartmentalized vehicles, which shall carry the waste to the solid waste management site.
2. Organic Waste shall be put into the compost pits for composting and inorganic waste
consisting of iron pieces, waste papers, wooden waste etc. shall be recycled and plastic waste

58

shall be used in the cement plants and waste to energy plants. Inert waste may be disposed of
in the sanitary landfill sites.
10.2 Limit Vehicle Use
Vehicular emissions are a major source of air pollution. Reducing the number of vehicles on
the road can significantly lower pollution levels.

10.2.1 Planned Actions
•

Public Transportation: Opting for buses, metros, and inter-city trains to reduce
individual vehicle use.

•

Carpooling: Share rides with family, friends, or colleagues to decrease the number of
vehicles on the road.

•

Walking or Cycling: For short distances, consider walking or cycling, which are not
only eco-friendly but also beneficial for your health.

10.3 Maintenance of the vehicles
Proper vehicle maintenance ensures that emissions are kept to a minimum, contributing to
better air quality.

59

10.2.1 Planned Actions
•

Regular Servicing: Have your vehicle serviced regularly to ensure the engine,
exhaust system, and fuel system are functioning efficiently.

•

Use Clean Fuels: If possible, switch to fuels with lower emissions such as Electric
Vehicles, and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).

CPCB, HSPCB and other reliable sources.

•

Health Precautions: On days when pollution levels are high, limit outdoor activities,
especially for vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with
respiratory conditions.

10.7 Conserve Energy
Reducing energy consumption helps decrease the demand for power generation, which in
turn reduces pollution from power plants.

10.7.1 Planned Actions
•

Energy-Efficient Lighting: Use LED bulbs and energy-efficient lighting solutions to
reduce energy consumption.

•

Smart Usage: Turn off lights and appliances when not in use. Consider using
programmable thermostats to optimize heating.

•

Use of Solar Technology: Extracting electric energy.
62

10.8 Report Violations
Addressing pollution sources promptly can prevent further environmental damage.
10.8.1 Planned Actions
•

11. Haryana Clean Air Project for Sustainable Development in collaboration
with The World Bank (HCAPSD)

The Government of Haryana in collaboration with World Bank aims to improve air quality
management across eight states in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). As part of their Regional
Action Plan, they intend to improve air quality and reduce emissions across a common
geographic area (the Indo-Gangetic plain), irrespective of the state boundaries. This is known
as the airshed approach. For implementation of the Regional Action Plan, the World Bank is
extending financial and technical assistance to the eight IGP States for seven years. Given the
geographic and strategic importance of Haryana in the IGP region and 14 out of its 22
districts falling in the National Capital Region (NCR), the World Bank approached the State
government on devising a project for Haryana as part of their regional action plan for the IGP
states.
The state has closely engaged with the World bank over the last one year and formulated the
‘Haryana Clean Air Project for Sustainable Development’. As part of the Haryana Clean Air
Project, the state is going to be provided financial assistance of USD 300 million (~2,498
crore rupees) from the World Bank to implement priority interventions for improvement of
air quality in Haryana and contribute towards the collective effort on air quality management
in the IGP region.

64

The project aims to reduce air pollution through a multi-sector, airshed based approach. It
also envisions building a pioneer model that can be replicated across India. The project will
support in:
1) Devising policies on air quality management
2) Building institutional capacity
3) Strengthening air quality monitoring infrastructure
4) Implementing sector-specific air pollution abatement measures
The interventions are designed with alignment of all the relevant departments including
Transport, Industries and Commerce, HSIIDC, PWD, Rural Development, Animal
Husbandry and Dairying, Food, Civil Supplies, and Consumer Affair Department, Municipal
corporations, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), and Faridabad
Metropolitan Development Authority (FMDA).
The project is set-up to be extended with a potential investment of up to INR 10,000+ crore in
the later phases of the project, a significant increase from the earlier proposal.

65

12. Way Forward
The Winter Action Plan 2024-25 outlines sector-wise interventions aimed at addressing the
root causes of pollution through targeted, strategic actions. Moving forward, the state will
focus on the following key areas:
12.1 Construction & Road Dust and Waste Management:
To mitigate dust and manage waste effectively, the state will enhance capacity building by
creating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for key stakeholders, including officers,
contractors, and construction workers. Comprehensive training will be provided to ensure
adherence to best practices. The state will also engage in the measurement and collection of
legacy Construction & Demolition (C&D) waste and will strengthen future C&D waste
management by expanding processing capacity and promoting the use of recycled waste
materials.
12.2 Transport:
The state will strengthen public transportation infrastructure by planning for the
transportation needs of all districts and advancing the electrification of intra- and inter-city
bus fleets. Efforts will be made to increase the adoption of electric vehicles across the state
by promoting demand for private 3-wheelers and cab aggregator 4-wheelers. The state will
also encourage the replacement of older fleets with cleaner vehicles by offering higher
incentives for purchasing electric vehicles post-scrappage. Additionally, a model for setting
up Automated Testing Stations (ATS) will be designed and implemented to monitor vehicle
health and facilitate the phasing out of old vehicles.
12.3 Agriculture:
To reduce stubble burning, the state will strengthen in-situ and ex-situ crop-residue
management by conducting a needs assessment to identify state-level requirements for Crop
Residue Management (CRM) machines. Large-scale training programs for farmers and field
officers will be conducted, and efforts will be made to diversify the reuse of stubble across
industries. The state will promote the use of Bio-decomposer among farmers through
awareness campaigns and initiate research to reduce the decomposition time from 60 to 15

66

days. Additionally, research will be undertaken to monitor and reduce secondary emissions
from agricultural fields and livestock farms.
12.4 Industries:
The state will accelerate the transition of industrial boilers to clean fuels by providing
financial incentives for the purchase of clean fuel boilers. To reduce emissions from diesel
generator (DG) sets, the state will promote the use of cleaner DG sets across industries by
incentivizing the retro fitment of emission control devices or the purchase of generators
running on dual fuel mode.
12.5 Institutional Strengthening:
The deployment of new continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) will
expand the state’s infrastructure based on population projections for 2030. Additionally, two
mobile vans equipped with real-time source apportionment technology will be deployed to
collect data on particulate matter (PM), metals, and other gaseous emissions across identified
hotspots. A Command Control Centre (CCC) will be set up at HSPCB to integrate data from
all sources, including CAAQMS, MAAQMS, mobile vans, low-cost sensors, and CCTV
cameras, enabling real-time monitoring of all interventions and their impact on air quality.
12.6 Clean Cooking:
Extensive information, education, and communication (IEC) activities will be conducted to
raise awareness about the benefits of clean cooking and encourage a shift towards cleaner
cooking practices, fostering social behaviour change.
In the upcoming winter season, the state government will continue to increase public
awareness, strictly enforce existing laws and directives issued by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,
National Green Tribunal, and the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).
Regular high-level reviews of on-ground actions will ensure that the Winter Action Plan
2024-25 is implemented in both letter and spirit, bringing the state closer to its goal of
significantly reducing air pollution and protecting the health and well-being of its citizens.
12.7 Solid Waste:

67

Solid waste dumping sites are known to release harmful gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO₂),
nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and suspended particulate matter. The dust
emitted from these sites can contribute to a range of health issues, from common colds to
serious diseases like cancer, as well as acute and chronic respiratory disorders, and lung damage
due to high concentrations of pollutants. The smoke generated from the incineration of waste
further exacerbates air pollution, affecting communities even far from the dumping sites.
Additionally, landfill gases, primarily consisting of methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂),
are potent greenhouse gases that contribute significantly to global warming.
Given the severe health and environmental risks associated with unmanaged solid waste, the
state will prioritize solid waste management strategies. This will include implementing
comprehensive waste segregation, promoting recycling, adopting scientific waste disposal
methods, and controlling emissions from landfill sites.

68
