COMMISSION FOR AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT
IN NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION AND ADJOINING AREAS

GRADED RESPONSE ACTION PLAN (GRAP)
FOR THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION (NCR)
(Revision: 21.11.2025)
1.
The GRAP for the entire NCR has been classified under 4 different stages
of adverse air quality in Delhi viz. Stage – I ‘Poor’ (AQI 201 – 300), Stage – II ‘Very
Poor (AQI 301-400), Stage – III ‘Severe’ (AQI 401-450) and Stage – IV ‘Severe +’
(AQI >450) respectively.

2.
Based on the dynamic model and weather/ meteorological forecast by
IMD / IITM on a day-to-day basis, actions under Stages I, II, III and IV of the GRAP
shall be invoked in advance of the AQI of Delhi reaching to the projected levels
of that stage, also provided that the higher projected AQI levels are likely to
sustain for longer period.

3.
Even if the AQI forecasts do not indicate the AQI of Delhi to be breaching
a particular threshold and under extreme meteorological conditions or due to
any episodic event the AQI breaches the threshold, that particular stage of the
GRAP shall be invoked with immediate effect in respect of actions / measures
that can be invoked immediately.

4.
Restrictive actions undertaken as per previous stages shall be continued,
in addition to the air pollution stage under which the restrictive actions are
envisaged to be taken. For example, restrictive actions under the Stage III
category, whenever invoked, shall be in addition to those under Stage I and II
respectively and so on and so forth.

5.
The Sub-Committee on GRAP constituted by the Commission shall meet
frequently to plan for advance action and issue necessary orders for invoking
various provisions of the GRAP, based on the prevalent air quality and the AQI
forecast to be provided by IMD from time to time. The Sub-Committee shall also
review the actions taken by various agencies responsible towards effective
implementation of the GRAP.

6.
The Chief Secretaries of NCR States and GNCTD shall frequently review
the actions and implementation of the GRAP especially when the air quality falls
or is likely to fall in the ‘Severe’ or ‘Severe +’ category (Stage III and beyond).

7.
The Commission may decide upon any exceptions and additional
measures to the schedule of the GRAP, under different air pollution categories
i.e., Stages I to IV, as per the prevalent AQI and weather forecast.
